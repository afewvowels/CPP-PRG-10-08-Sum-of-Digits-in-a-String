//  Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of single-digit numbers with nothing
//  separating them. Read the input as a C-string or a string object. The program
//  should display the sum of all the single-digit numbers in the string. For example, if the
//  user enters 2514, the program should display 12, which is the sum of 2, 5, 1, and 4.
//  The program should also display the highest and lowest digits in the string.
